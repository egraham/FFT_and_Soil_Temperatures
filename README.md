# FFT and Soil Temperatures
R Shiny script to model sub-surface soil temperatures using a simple heat-transfer model coupled with FFT.

This work is a clean-up of a workshop I presented on using R in ecological modeling.  It describes FFT and then uses it to model soil temperatures at depth. This demonstration is based on work from:

Graham EA, Lam Y, Yuen EM.  2010.  Forest understory soil temperatures and heat flux calculated using a Fourier model and scaled using a digital camera.  Agricultural and Forest Meteorology 150: 640â€“649.
